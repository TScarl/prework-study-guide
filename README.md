# prework-study-guide

## Description

I undertook the creation of the prework study guide to help teach me how to code. it explains some of the basics on how to use Github, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. This webpage is a great place for people new to coding to get a basic idea of the basics needed for being a web developer.

During the creation of my webpage, I have learned some of the basic elements of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and GitHub.

I learnt that HTML is the basis of any webpage, it provides the structure by having different sectionshe, e.g. head, header, main, body, section and footer. I also learnt how to create classes and ordered or unordered lists.

I learnt that CSS create the flow and style of the webpage by editing the font size and style, adding colors, and how to use the box model in order to create space and borders for my work.

Javascript gives interactivity to the webpage, with else if statements which allow different scenarios to play out depending on how the user interacts with the webpage... or randomly with functions like math.random.

GitHub is a space which allows programers to show their work to each other or to work on the same project together, even at the same time, without interuptting each others flow.

## Usage

The prework study guide was designed for people to get prepared for the bootcamp by giving them a quick preview of a few coding languages. My webpage  gives them some of the basic information they may require to help them understand the languages, and if they use the devtools console (ctrl, shift I (on windows)) they will see my javascript running in the background.
